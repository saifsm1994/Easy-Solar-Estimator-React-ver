# Easy-Solar-Estimator-React-ver
This project is a React.js port of EasySolarEstimator application I developed.

It uses ip geolocation data to estimate a users location before comparing it against NASA solar data sets to determine how much power a given unoptimized perfectly horizontal solar panel will output in a year and the rough costs of such a system.

The original project was created as part of my final undergraduate thesis for Quest University
